Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected.

WordCount: 22
I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us.

WordCount: 32
Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill.

WordCount: 28
They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.

WordCount: 35
Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is morning to be good on?

WordCount: 31
And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine!

WordCount: 36
Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.

WordCount: 20
We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty .disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!

WordCount: 37
Then he took out his morning letters, and begin to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away.

WordCount: 31
But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.

WordCount: 28
Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered?

WordCount: 30
Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons?

WordCount: 23
Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve.

WordCount: 22
Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!

WordCount: 25
You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers.

WordCount: 29
I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.

WordCount: 29
All the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, land that is not without hope.

WordCount: 24
With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude.

WordCount: 26
He had only just had break fast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright.

WordCount: 32
A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?

WordCount: 26
They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell.

WordCount: 25
Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.

WordCount: 30
But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade.

WordCount: 35
The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper.

WordCount: 37
Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, t was FIVE. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall.

WordCount: 35
Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.

WordCount: 27
Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more!

WordCount: 22
For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr.

WordCount: 24
Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house.

WordCount: 31
The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses.

WordCount: 29
Smash the bottles and burn the corks! Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! Pour the milk on the pantry floor! Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!

WordCount: 36
Splash the wine on every door! Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl; Pound them up with a thumping pole; And when you've finished, if any are whole, Send them down the hall to roll !

WordCount: 25
Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away ere break of day To seek the pale enchanted gold.

WordCount: 26
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells In places deep, where dark things sleep, In hollow halls beneath the fells.

WordCount: 28
For ancient king and elvish lord There many a gloaming golden hoard They shaped and wrought, and light they caught To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

WordCount: 29
Goblets they carved there for themselves And harps of gold; where no man delves There lay they long, and many a song Was sung unheard by men or elves.

WordCount: 28
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire Laid low their towers and houses frail. The mountain smoked beneath the moon; The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.

WordCount: 33
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon. Far over the misty mountains grim To dungeons deep and caverns dim We must away, ere break of day, To win our harps and gold from him!

WordCount: 35
As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves.

WordCount: 29
He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns.

WordCount: 24
Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark.

WordCount: 25
Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed.

WordCount: 32
It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.

WordCount: 34
I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house.

WordCount: 28
Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce.

WordCount: 24
I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr.

WordCount: 35
Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal.

WordCount: 39
If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself.

WordCount: 26
I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.

WordCount: 29
So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the Long Lake.

WordCount: 32
Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be found.

WordCount: 23
And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let's get on and make some plans.

WordCount: 32
Long ago in my grandfather Thror's time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map.

WordCount: 26
They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skilful most richly.

WordCount: 28
Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the.

WordCount: 31
By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them.

WordCount: 26
Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages.

WordCount: 35
Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone.

WordCount: 31
The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards.

WordCount: 36
They looked very grim but they said very little. When I asked how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one day in the proper time I should know.

WordCount: 30
But apparently they made a map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir.

WordCount: 38
I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked.

WordCount: 35
Moria. Your father went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the Mountain.

WordCount: 23
Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped.

WordCount: 27
I tried to save your father, but it was too late. He was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key.

WordCount: 31
Don't be absurd! He is an enemy quite beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world.

WordCount: 31
The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!

WordCount: 24
One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up.

WordCount: 30
There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen.

WordCount: 31
By that time the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before.

WordCount: 23
Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for your offer of professional assistance our grateful acceptance.

WordCount: 32
Gandalf's hands, and running as fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water, and then on for a whole mile or more.

WordCount: 27
Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him. Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village.

WordCount: 28
They were on ponies, and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo.

WordCount: 24
Dwalin. They were too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo would have thought of him, I daren't think.

WordCount: 33
His only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard. They had not been riding very long when up came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse.

WordCount: 26
These didn't come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but still he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.

WordCount: 33
Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher and higher, dark with trees. On some of them were old castles with an evil look, as if they had been built by wicked people.

WordCount: 34
Everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as May can be, even in merry tales, but now it was cold and wet.

WordCount: 28
Bother burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!

WordCount: 25
It was not the last time that he wished that! Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or taking any notice of the hobbit.

WordCount: 32
I don't know what river it was, a rushing red one, swollen with the rains of the last few days, that came down from the hills and mountains in front of them.

WordCount: 24
Soon it was nearly dark. The winds broke up the grey clouds, and a waning moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags.

WordCount: 36
Not until then did they notice that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while.

WordCount: 29
They moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, and the drip, drip, was most annoying.

WordCount: 23
Some said they could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night.

WordCount: 28
They have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find.

WordCount: 23
This remark was repeated by everybody. Then the rain began to pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin began to fight.

WordCount: 28
Off Bilbo had to go, before he could explain that he could not hoot even once like any kind of owl any more than fly like a bat.

WordCount: 22
They were toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off their fingers. There was a fine toothsome smell.

WordCount: 23
Also there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and they were drinking out of jugs. But they were trolls. Obviously trolls.

WordCount: 33
Yer can't expect folk to stop here for ever just to be et by you and Bert. You've et a village and a half between yer, since we come down from the mountains.

WordCount: 35
He took a big bite off a sheep's leg he was toasting, and wiped his lips on his sleeve. Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each.

WordCount: 22
Others more practical but with less professional pride would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it.

WordCount: 25
Then the night could have been spent cheerily. Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done.

WordCount: 27
Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink. Then Bilbo plucked up courage and put his little hand in William's enormous pocket.

WordCount: 27
I cook, if you see what I mean. I'll cook beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you won't have me for supper.

WordCount: 26
Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly as they could.

WordCount: 25
Balin, who was wondering where in all this commotion Bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over his head, and he was down.

WordCount: 24
And so they did. With sacks in their hands, that they used for carrying off mutton and other plunder, they waited in the shadows.

WordCount: 33
As each dwarf came up and looked at the fire, and the spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his head, and he was down.

WordCount: 35
Soon Dwalin lay by Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap, and Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire.

WordCount: 25
He came expecting mischief, and didn't need to see his friends' legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all well.

WordCount: 39
Thorin, and he jumped forward to the fire, before they could leap on him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and Bert got that end in his eye before he could step aside.

WordCount: 32
Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin's face. Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made him howl, I can tell you.

WordCount: 27
But just at that moment William came up behind and popped a sack right over Thorin's head and down to his toes. And so the fight ended.

WordCount: 33
William; and so the argument beg all over again. In the end they decided to mince them fine and boil them. So they got a black pot, and they took out their knives.

WordCount: 36
Tom. And so the argument began all over again, and went on hotter than ever, until at last they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash them, and boil them next time.

WordCount: 24
William's. But it wasn't. For just at that moment the light came over the hill, and there was a mighty twitter in the branches.

WordCount: 25
William never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at him.

WordCount: 26
Then Bilbo understood. It was the wizard's voice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them.

WordCount: 28
Anyhow you are wasting time now. Don't you realize that the trolls must have a cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in?

WordCount: 33
He held out a largish key, though no doubt William had thought it very small and secret. It must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was turned to stone.

WordCount: 30
Two caught their eyes particularly, because of their beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these; and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath.

WordCount: 33
They were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men in these parts and days; but when we can read the runes on them, we shall know more about them.

WordCount: 27
By that time they felt like breakfast, and being very hungry they did not turn their noses up at what they had got from the trolls' larder.

WordCount: 26
Their own provisions were very scanty. Now they had bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon to toast in the embers of the fire.

WordCount: 26
I went on to spy out our road. It will soon become dangerous and difficult. Also I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions.

WordCount: 28
You will get there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and find out all about it As I was saying I met two of Elrond's people.

WordCount: 27
I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back. Looking behind I saw a fire in the distance and made for it. So now you know.

WordCount: 36
They did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved; nor the next day, nor the day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far away on either side.

WordCount: 26
One morning they forded a river at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam. The far bank was steep and slippery.

WordCount: 24
When they got to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the great mountains had marched down very near to them.

WordCount: 28
That is only the beginning of the Misty Mountains, and we have to get through, or over, or under those somehow, before we can come into Wilderland beyond.

WordCount: 28
And it is a deal of a way even from the other side of them to the Lonely Mountain in the East Where Smaug lies on our treasure.

WordCount: 35
You are come to the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of us is the fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last Homely House.

WordCount: 31
That sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was not so easy as it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains.

WordCount: 31
They came on unexpected valleys, narrow with deep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet, and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water at the bottom.

WordCount: 28
There were gullies that they could almost leap over; but very deep with waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither jump nor climb into.

WordCount: 23
Altogether it was a very slow business following the track, even guided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well.

WordCount: 37
His head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and they followed his head, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when the day began to fail.

WordCount: 26
There were moths fluttering about, and the light became very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo's pony began to stumble over roots and stones.

WordCount: 25
Their spirits rose as they went down and down. The trees changed to beech and oak, and hire was a comfortable feeling in the twilight.

WordCount: 27
The last green had almost faded out of the grass, when they came at length to an open glade not far above the banks of the stream.

WordCount: 30
No knowing, no knowing What brings Mister Baggins, And Balin and Dwalin down into the valley in June ha! ha! O! Will you be staying, Or will you be flying?

WordCount: 32
Your ponies are straying! The daylight is dying! To fly would be folly, To stay would be jolly And listen and hark Till the end of the dark to our tune ha!

WordCount: 34
So they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you think it. Not that they would care they would only laugh all the more if you told them so.

WordCount: 32
They were elves of course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a little frightened of them too.

WordCount: 37
Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written down in full. At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin.

WordCount: 35
We will set you right, but you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge. Are you going to stay a bit and sing with us, or will you go straight on?

WordCount: 31
Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay awhile. Elvish singing is not a thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for such things.

WordCount: 31
Also he would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to know his name and all about him, although he had never been them before.

WordCount: 35
He comes into. many tales, but his part in the story of Bilbo's great adventure is only a small one, though important, as you will see, if we ever get to the end of it.

WordCount: 35
Evil things did not come into that valley. I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the tales or one or two of the songs that they heard in that house.

WordCount: 30
All of them, the ponies as well, grew refreshed and strong in a few days there. Their clothes were mended as well as their bruises, their tempers and their hopes.

WordCount: 28
Their bags were filled with food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring them over the mountain passes. Their plans were improved with the best advice.

WordCount: 30
North. I have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of Moria, since the dwarf and goblin war.

WordCount: 31
He loved maps, as I have told you before; and he also liked runes and letters and cunning handwriting, though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery.

WordCount: 38
They can only be seen when the moon shines behind them, and what is more, with the more cunning sort it must be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when they were written.

WordCount: 33
The dwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens, as your friends could tell you. These must have been written on a midsummer's eve in a crescent moon, a long while ago.

WordCount: 26
Autumn on the threshold of Winter. We still call it Durin's Day when the last moon of Autumn and the sun are in the sky together.

WordCount: 28
Elrond, and he gave the map back to Thorin; and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon the midsummer's eve.

WordCount: 27
The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond and the knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass.

WordCount: 27
Long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the Last Homely House miles behind, they were still going up and up and up.

WordCount: 35
It was a hard path and a dangerous path, a crooked way and a lonely and a long. Now they could look back over the lands they had left, laid out behind them far below.

WordCount: 27
Elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they' had spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond.

WordCount: 23
More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night, when storms come up from East and West and make war.

WordCount: 31
Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a narrow place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them.

WordCount: 30
Then came a wind and a rain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail about in every direction, so that an overhanging rock was no protection at all.

WordCount: 28
Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their heads down and their tails between their legs, and some of them were whinnying with fright.

WordCount: 33
Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants himself. The end of their argument was that they sent Fill and Kili to look for a better shelter.

WordCount: 25
You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after. So it proved on this occasion.

WordCount: 37
Still it was not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock standing out into the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain.

WordCount: 22
And that was the last time that they used the ponies, packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them.

WordCount: 34
At that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage.

WordCount: 30
There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say tinder and flint.

WordCount: 24
It sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed to the clap, snap! and the crush, smash! and to the ugly laughter of their ho, ho!

WordCount: 24
The general meaning of the song was only too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and whipped them with a swish, smack!

WordCount: 34
There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the bent swords that they use.

WordCount: 23
Up to no good, I'll warrant! Spying on the private business of my people, I guess! Thieves, I shouldn't be surprised to learn!

WordCount: 28
So you say! Might I ask what you were doing up in the mountains at all, and where you were coming from, and where you were going to?

WordCount: 26
Several of our people were struck by lightning in the cave, when we invited these creatures to come below; and they are as dead as stones.

WordCount: 32
They knew the sword at once. It had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls.

WordCount: 25
Slash them! Beat them! Bite them! Gnash them! Take them away to dark holes full of snakes, and never let them see the light again!

WordCount: 20
The yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description.

WordCount: 26
Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad.

WordCount: 27
Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light. Bilbo saw it go right through the Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage.

WordCount: 22
He fell dead, and the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness. The sword went back into its sheath.

WordCount: 32
It burned with a rage that made it gleam if goblins were about; now it was bright as blue flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of the cave.

WordCount: 24
Gandalf thought of most things; and though he could not do everything, he could do a great deal for friends in a tight comer.

WordCount: 35
Well, well! it might be worse, and then again it might be a good deal better. No ponies, and no food, and no knowing quite where we are, and hordes of angry goblins just behind!

WordCount: 29
Bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his nose in his heat and terror. At this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin with him.

WordCount: 32
The ones in front dropped their torches and gave one yell before they were killed. The ones behind yelled still more, and leaped back knocking over those that were running after them.

WordCount: 37
It was quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that comer. By that time the dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of the goblins' realm.

WordCount: 30
When the goblins discovered that, they put out their torches and they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest runners with the sharpest ears and eyes.

WordCount: 32
These ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, and with hardly any more noise than bats. That is why neither Bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even Gandalf heard them coming.

WordCount: 36
Nor did they see them. But they were seen by the goblins that ran silently up behind, for Gandalf was letting his wand give out a faint light to help the dwarves as they went along.

WordCount: 30
Riddles in the Dark When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as with them shut. No one was anywhere near him.

WordCount: 36
It was a turning point in his career, but he did not know it. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not seem of any particular use at the moment.

WordCount: 24
He did not go much further, but sat down on the cold floor and gave himself up to complete miserableness, for a long while.

WordCount: 32
The truth was he had been lying quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while. After some time he felt for his pipe.

WordCount: 26
It was not broken, and that was something. Then he felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco in it, and that was something more.

WordCount: 33
Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all, and that shattered his hopes completely. Just as well for him, as he agreed when he came to his senses.

WordCount: 25
Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco would have brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible place.

WordCount: 32
So up he got, and trotted along with his little sword held in front of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all of a patter and a pitter.

WordCount: 33
Now certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place. But you must remember it was not quite so tight for him as it would have been for me or for you.

WordCount: 30
There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as he knew by the glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand on the wall.

WordCount: 27
I do not know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was tireder than tired.

WordCount: 24
It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond. Suddenly without any warning he trotted splash into water!

WordCount: 32
Still he did not dare to wade out into the darkness. He could not swim; and he thought, too, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in the water.

WordCount: 32
Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins have made for themselves there are other things living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark.

WordCount: 27
Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don't know where he came from, nor who or what he was.

WordCount: 24
They very seldom did, for they had a feeling that something unpleasant was lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain.

WordCount: 22
Great Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a fancy for fish from the lake, and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back.

WordCount: 29
Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake. He was watching Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes.

WordCount: 28
And when he said gollum he made a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. That is how he got his name, though he always called himself 'my precious.

WordCount: 26
The hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears, and he suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him.

WordCount: 30
This is what he had come to find out, for he was not really very hungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise he would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards.

WordCount: 34
Bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until he found out more about the creature, whether he was quite alone, whether he was fierce or hungry, and whether he was a friend of the goblins.

WordCount: 25
Does it guess easy? It must have a competition with us, my preciouss! If precious asks, and it doesn't answer, we eats it, my preciousss.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo, who was still thinking uncomfortably about eating. Fortunately he had once heard something rather like this before, and getting his wits back he thought of the answer.

WordCount: 22
It lies behind stars and under hills, And empty holes it fills. It comes first and follows after, Ends life, kills laughter.

WordCount: 27
A box without hinges, key, or lid, Yet golden treasure inside is hid, he asked to gain time, until he could think of a really hard one.

WordCount: 25
This he thought a dreadfully easy chestnut, though he had not asked it in the usual words. But it proved a nasty poser for Gollum.

WordCount: 39
Gollum, beginning to climb out of his boat on to the shore to get at Bilbo. But when he put his long webby foot in the water, a fish jumped out in a fright and fell on Bilbo's toes.

WordCount: 27
Gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but Bilbo asked another riddle as quick as ever be could, so that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think.

WordCount: 32
It was not really the right time for this riddle, but Bilbo was in a hurry. Gollum might have had some trouble guessing it, if he had asked it at another time.

WordCount: 22
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays king, ruins town, And beats high mountain down.

WordCount: 36
Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these things.

WordCount: 35
He had a feeling that the answer was quite different and that he ought to know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get frightened, and that is bad for thinking.

WordCount: 26
Gollum began to get out of his boat. He flapped into the water and paddled to the bank; Bilbo could see his eyes coming towards him.

WordCount: 30
Bilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer. Gollum was disappointed once more; and now he was getting angry, and also tired of the game.

WordCount: 25
Gollum. But Bilbo simply could not think of any question with that nasty wet cold thing sitting next to him, and pawing and poking him.

WordCount: 23
Gollum. Bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; he gripped on his little sword; he even felt in his pocket with his other hand.

WordCount: 32
He hissed and spluttered and rocked himself backwards and forwards, and slapped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but still he did not dare to waste his last guess.

WordCount: 28
He tried to sound bold and cheerful, but he did not feel at all sure how the game was going to end, whether Gollum guessed right or not.

WordCount: 25
Bilbo very much relieved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put his back to the nearest wall, and held out his little sword.

WordCount: 28
But he felt he could not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do for him to slide out of it.

WordCount: 28
And after all that last question had not been a genuine riddle according to the ancient laws. But at any rate Gollum did not at once attack him.

WordCount: 30
Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. But what has it got in its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but not nothing.

WordCount: 28
But it must wait, yes it must. We can't go up the tunnels so hasty. We must go and get some things first, yes, things to help us.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo, relieved to think of Gollum going away. He thought he was just making an excuse and did not mean to come back. What was Gollum talking about?

WordCount: 27
What useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake? But he was wrong. Gollum did mean to come back. He was angry now and hungry.

WordCount: 32
So he had always said to himself. But who knows how Gollum came by that present, ages ago in the old days when such rings were still at large in the world?

WordCount: 30
And still sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear to be parted from it any longer, or when he was very, very, hungry, and tired of fish.

WordCount: 34
Then he would creep along dark passages looking for stray goblins. He might even venture into places where the torches were lit and made his eyes blink and smart; for he would be safe.

WordCount: 28
That is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from Bilbo's side, and flapped back to his boat, and went off into the dark.

WordCount: 31
Bilbo thought he had heard the last of him. Still he waited a while; for he had no idea how to find his way out alone. Suddenly he heard a screech.

WordCount: 28
I want to get unlost. And I won the game, and you promised. So come along! Come and let me out, and then go on with your looking!

WordCount: 30
Utterly miserable as Gollum sounded, Bilbo could not find much pity in his heart, and he had a feeling that anything Gollum wanted so much could hardly be something good.

WordCount: 27
The sound came hissing louder and sharper, and as he looked towards it, to his alarm Bilbo now saw two small points of light peering at him.

WordCount: 27
Bilbo could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature, but he saw that all was up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any rate.

WordCount: 30
Just in time he turned and ran blindly back up the dark passage down which he had come, keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand.

WordCount: 28
He put his left hand in his pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly slipped on to his groping forefinger. The hiss was close behind him.

WordCount: 33
There seemed nothing else to do. It was no good crawling back down to Gollum's water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might lead him to some way of escape without meaning to.

WordCount: 26
Curse the Baggins! It's gone! What has it got in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my precious. He's found it, yes he must have.

WordCount: 25
Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that's it. When we came this way last, when we twisted that nassty young squeaker.

WordCount: 28
We guesses, precious, only guesses. We can't know till we find the nassty creature and squeezes it. But it doesn't know what the present can do, does it?

WordCount: 31
It'll just keep it in its pocketses. It doesn't know, and it can't go far. It's lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. It doesn't know the way out It said so.

WordCount: 36
It said so, yes; but it's tricksy. It doesn't say what it means. It won't say what it's got in its pocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must know a way out, yes.

WordCount: 20
Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if it's got the present, our precious present, then goblinses will get it, gollum!

WordCount: 25
He'll be there but not seen. Not even our clever eyeses will notice him; and he'll come creepsy and tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!

WordCount: 25
Then let's stop talking, precious, and make haste. If the Baggins has gone that way, we must go quick and see. Go! Not far now.

WordCount: 26
He had heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; but it was hard to believe that he really had found one, by accident.

WordCount: 35
And so on and on. As the count grew he slowed down, and he began to get shaky and weepy; for he was leaving the water further and further behind, and he was getting afraid.

WordCount: 23
Bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse; but Gollum stiffened at once, and sniffed, and his eyes went green.

WordCount: 30
Though he was only a black shadow in the gleam of his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered for a spring.

WordCount: 26
Bilbo almost stopped breathing, and went stiff himself. He was desperate. He must get away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had any strength left.

WordCount: 29
He must fight. He must stab the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. It meant to kill him. No, not a fair fight. He was invisible now.

WordCount: 30
All these thoughts passed in a flash of a second. He trembled. And then quite suddenly in another flash, as if lifted by a new strength and resolve, he leaped.

WordCount: 21
All at once there came a bloodcurdling shriek, filled with hatred and despair. Gollum was defeated. He dared go no further.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo, not knowing that even the big ones, the ores of the mountains, go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground.

WordCount: 24
Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after a while it climbed steeply. That slowed Bilbo down.

WordCount: 26
The goblins stopped short. They could not see a sign of him. He had vanished. They yelled twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.

WordCount: 23
Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords rattled, goblins cursed and swore and ran hither and thither, falling over one another and getting very angry.

WordCount: 27
It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it nearly to. Bilbo struggled but he could not move it. He tried to squeeze through the crack.

WordCount: 29
Pan into the Fire Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost hood, cloak, food, pony, his buttons and his friends.

WordCount: 34
I seem to have got right to the other side of the Misty Mountains, right to the edge of the Land Beyond! Where and O where can Gandalf and the dwarves have got to?

WordCount: 30
He still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the slopes beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside him.

WordCount: 25
He wondered whether he ought not, now he had the magic ring, to go back into the horrible, horrible, tunnels and look for his friends.

WordCount: 27
He stopped and listened. It did not sound like goblins; so he crept forward carefully. He was on a stony path winding downwards with a rocky wall.

WordCount: 28
Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They were discussing all that had happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering and debating what they were to do now.

WordCount: 39
I brought him, and I don't bring things that are of no use. Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out of the mess as best you can yourselves.

WordCount: 20
Good heavens! Can you ask! Goblins fighting and biting in the dark, everybody falling over bodies and hitting one another!

WordCount: 25
Bilbo stepping down into the middle of them, and slipping off the ring. Bless me, how they jumped! Then they shouted with surprise and delight.

WordCount: 24
Gandalf's words, they doubted no longer. Balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it was a very clever bit of work.

WordCount: 37
Show me the way out!' But he came at me to kill me, and I ran, and fell over, and he missed me in the dark. Then I followed him, because I heard him talking to himself.

WordCount: 29
He thought I really knew the way out, and so he was making for it. And then he sat down in the entrance, and I could not get by.

WordCount: 32
The dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect, when he talked about dodging guards, jumping over Gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not very difficult or very alarming.

WordCount: 33
He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out.

WordCount: 26
Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves, Bilbo had not heard it.

WordCount: 28
But their main gate used to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught people benighted near their gates.

WordCount: 31
He followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up the best magic he could in the shadows.

WordCount: 30
They will be out after us in hundreds when night comes on; and already shadows are lengthening. They can smell our footsteps for hours and hours after we have passed.

WordCount: 40
We must be miles on before dusk. There will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and that is lucky. Not that they mind the moon much, but it will give us a little light to steer by.

WordCount: 28
But we are not at the point to which our pass would have brought us; we are too far to the North, and have some awkward country ahead.

WordCount: 27
Bilbo, who was suddenly aware that he had not had a meal since the night before the night before last. Just think of that for a hobbit!

WordCount: 25
They limped along now as fast as they were able down the gentle slopes of a pine forest in a slanting path leading steadily southwards.

WordCount: 31
Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see Thorin's beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves' breathing like a loud noise.

WordCount: 26
Gandalf. After what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no trees grew. The moon was up and was shining into the clearing.

WordCount: 35
Somehow it struck all of them as not at all a nice place, although there was nothing wrong to see. All of a sudden they heard a howl away down hill, a long shuddering howl.

WordCount: 35
It was answered by another away to the right and a good deal nearer to them; then by another not far away to the left. It was wolves howling at the moon, wolves gathering together!

WordCount: 27
There were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins' hole at home, but he knew that noise. He had had it described to him often enough in tales.

WordCount: 28
Edge of the Wild on the borders of the unknown. Wolves of that sort smell keener than goblins, and do not need to see you to catch you!

WordCount: 28
Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up.

WordCount: 25
They found them as quick as ever they could, you can guess; and up they went as high as ever they could trust the branches.

WordCount: 31
Gandalf, who was a good deal taller than the others, had found a tree into which they could not climb, a large pine standing at the very edge of the glade.

WordCount: 29
So Dori actually climbed out of the tree and let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back. Just at that moment the wolves trotted howling into the clearing.

WordCount: 28
In a minute there was a whole pack of them yelping all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk, with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out.

WordCount: 25
I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though Bilbo did not understand it. The Wargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds.

WordCount: 35
But in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, especially to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they often got the Wargs to help and shared the plunder with them.

WordCount: 32
This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and their wives and children, but also because of the danger which now threatened Gandalf and his friends.

WordCount: 37
All the same he was not going to let them have it all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground below.

WordCount: 31
He gathered the huge pinecones from the branches of his tree. Then he set one alight with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down among the circle of the wolves.

WordCount: 25
The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and cheered. The rage of the wolves was terrible to see, and the commotion they made filled all the forest.

WordCount: 33
Also he could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides from their gate and wound into the wood.

WordCount: 31
A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places.

WordCount: 25
Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen was going on; but they goon learned what had really happened.

WordCount: 27
Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing. Some got all the wolves together in a pack.

WordCount: 35
Smoke was in Bilbo's eyes, he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer bonfire.

WordCount: 20
Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.

WordCount: 21
Fifteen birds in five firtrees, their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze! But, funny little birds, they had no wings!

WordCount: 27
O what shall we do with the funny little things? Roast 'em alive, or stew them in a pot; fry them, boil them and eat them hot?

WordCount: 25
Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little birds!

WordCount: 30
But they took no notice, and they went on singing. Burn, burn tree and fern! Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch To light the night for our delight, Ya hey!

WordCount: 25
In a moment it spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked. Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree.

WordCount: 26
The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins.

WordCount: 25
That would have been the end of him, though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt.

WordCount: 25
But he never leaped. Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and was gone.

WordCount: 24
There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken.

WordCount: 28
Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces.

WordCount: 27
The flames about the trees sprang suddenly up above the highest branches. They went up in crackling fire. There was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke.

WordCount: 25
The pale peaks of the mountains were coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock sticking out of black shadows. Summer or not, it seemed very cold.

WordCount: 26
He shut his eyes and wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then he imagined what would happen if he did not. He felt sick.

WordCount: 32
The flight ended only just in time for him, just before his arms gave way. He loosed Dori's ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough platform of an eagle's eyrie.

WordCount: 28
Now I know what a piece of bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out of the pan on a fork and put back on the shelf!

WordCount: 31
Bilbo sitting up and looking anxiously at the eagle who was perched close by. He wondered what other nonsense he had been saying, and if the eagle would think it rude.

WordCount: 26
The eagle came back, seized him in his talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off. This time he flew only a short way.

WordCount: 37
There was no path down on to it save by flying; and no path down off it except by jumping over a precipice. There he found all the others sitting with their backs to the mountain wall.

WordCount: 25
The Lord of the Eagles also was there and was speaking to Gandalf. It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all.

WordCount: 30
He was discussing plans with the Great Eagle for carrying the dwarves and himself and Bilbo far away and setting them down well on their journey across the plains below.

WordCount: 25
Take us where and as far as you will! We are already deeply obliged to you. But in the meantime we are famished with hunger.

WordCount: 33
Lord of the Eagles. Later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures of the dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell.

WordCount: 25
The eagles had brought up dry boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits, hares, and a small sheep. The dwarves managed all the preparations.

WordCount: 33
Bilbo was too weak to help, and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used to having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook.

WordCount: 33
So he sat down and wished in vain for a wash and a brush. He did not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit.

WordCount: 29
And after that he had to get ready for a fresh start. This time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle's back and cling between his wings.

WordCount: 32
Bilbo opened an eye to peep and saw that the birds were already high up and the world was far away, and the mountains were falling back behind them into the distance.

WordCount: 28
You need not be frightened like a rabbit, even if you look rather like one. It is a fair morning with little wind. What is finer than flying?

WordCount: 31
After a good while the eagles must have seen the point they were making for, 'even from their great height, for they began to go down circling round in great spirals.

WordCount: 29
I have done it. Indeed we are now a good deal further east than I ever meant to come with you, for after all this is not my adventure.

WordCount: 34
The dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had begun to think Gandalf was going in come all the way and would always be there to help them out of difficulties.

WordCount: 32
Now I can tell you that. You are still some miles north of the path which we should have been following, if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurry.

WordCount: 37
Very few people live in these parts, unless they have come here since I was last down this way, which is some years ago. But there is somebody that I know of, who lives not far away.

WordCount: 25
Carrock I believe he calls it. He does not come here often, certainly not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for him.

WordCount: 37
In fact it would be very dangerous. We must go and find him; and if all goes well at our meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles 'farewell wherever you fare!

WordCount: 26
After that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed in the river, which was shallow and clear and stony at the ford.

WordCount: 35
You must all be very polite when I introduce you. I shall introduce you slowly, two by two, I think; and you must be careful not to annoy him, or heaven knows what will happen.

WordCount: 37
They work for him and talk to him. He does not eat them; neither does he hunt or eat wild animals. He keeps hives and hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on cream and honey.

WordCount: 26
Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more questions. They still had a long way to walk before them.

WordCount: 32
It was the middle of the afternoon before they noticed that great patches of flowers had begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing together as if they had been planted.

WordCount: 27
There was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in the air. Bees were busy everywhere. And such bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like them.

WordCount: 29
They were bigger than hornets. The drones were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, and the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery gold.

WordCount: 27
Bombur is fattest and will do for two, he had better come alone and last. Come on Mr. Baggins! There is a gate somewhere round this way.

WordCount: 25
Gandalf. As for Bilbo he could easily have trotted through his legs without ducking his head to miss the fringe of the man's brown tunic.

WordCount: 30
I have heard of you, if you have not heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my good cousin Radagast who lives near the Southern borders of Mirkwood?

WordCount: 26
To tell you the truth, we have lost our luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather in need of help, or at least advice.

WordCount: 36
It faced south and was still warm and filled with the light of the westering sun which slanted into it, and fell golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to the steps.

WordCount: 34
Well to tell you the truth, I did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until I found out if you were busy. I will give a call, if I may.

WordCount: 26
So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently Thorin and Dori came round the house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them.

WordCount: 32
Well, no. They don't seem all to have come when I whistled. Shy, I expect. You see, we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain.

WordCount: 30
Beorn. Gandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori were there almost before he had stopped, for, if you remember, Gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five minutes.

WordCount: 31
A fine comic one. Come in my merry men, and what are your names? I don't want your service just now, only your names; and then sit down and stop wagging!

WordCount: 23
I followed down into the main hall, which was crowded with goblins. The Great Goblin was there with thirty or forty armed guards.

WordCount: 28
A dozen! That's the first time I've heard eight called a dozen. Or have you still got some more jacks that haven't yet come out of their boxes?

WordCount: 30
So Gandalf went on with the tale, until he came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of the lower gate, and their horror when they found that Mr.

WordCount: 28
Fourteen! That's the first time I've heard one from ten leave fourteen. You mean nine, or else you haven't told me yet all the names of your party.

WordCount: 25
Well, of course you haven't seen Oin and Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they are. I hope you will forgive them for bothering you.

WordCount: 34
O let 'em all come! Hurry up! Come along, you two, and sit down! But look here, Gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the hobbit that was lost.

WordCount: 28
Bombur pulling up behind. He was fat, and also angry at being left till last. He refused to wait five minutes, and followed immediately after the other two.

WordCount: 34
Well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, I suppose that is all that there were up the trees. Now perhaps we can finish this story without any more interruptions.

WordCount: 30
These were all the chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful animals that waited on him.

WordCount: 25
When dinner was over they began to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed to be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them.

WordCount: 29
Whether it was magic or not, it seemed to Bilbo that he heard a sound like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters, and the hoot of owls.

WordCount: 28
Soon he began to nod with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far away, until he woke with a start. The great door had creaked and slammed.

WordCount: 28
The wind came down from mountains cold, and like a tide it roared and rolled; the branches groaned, the forest moaned, and leaves were laid upon the mould.

WordCount: 27
The wind went on from West to East ; all movement in the forest ceased, but shrill and harsh across the marsh its whistling voices were released.

WordCount: 29
It left the world and took its flight over the wide seas of the night. The moon set sail upon the gale, and stars were fanned to leaping light.

WordCount: 27
Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised platform between the pillars and the outer wall.

WordCount: 22
For him there was a little mattress of straw and woollen blankets. He snuggled into them very gladly, summertime though it was.

WordCount: 27
He dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in spite of his fears. It was full morning when he awoke.

WordCount: 28
One of the dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on to the floor.

WordCount: 32
We have been about looking for Beorn ever since the sun got up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though we found breakfast laid as soon as we went out.

WordCount: 23
I should say there were little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn.

WordCount: 29
I followed these as far as the Carrock. There they disappeared into the river, but the water was too deep and strong beyond the rock for me to cross.

WordCount: 32
It is easy enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the ford, but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel.

WordCount: 35
I had to walk miles before I found a place where the river was wide and shallow enough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back again to pick up the tracks again.

WordCount: 21
Then he woke up when everyone else was asleep, and he heard the same scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as before.

WordCount: 32
As it is, I can only say that I have hurried home as fast as I could to see that you were safe, and to offer you any help that I can.

WordCount: 31
The making of these was one of his secrets; but honey was in them, as in most of his foods, and they were good to eat, though they made one thirsty.

WordCount: 23
And in the dim shadows of that place I don't think you will shoot anything, wholesome or unwholesome, without straying from the path.

WordCount: 36
That is all the advice I can give you. Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot help you much; you must depend on your luck and your courage and the food I send with you.

WordCount: 39
At the gate of the forest I must ask you to send back my horse and my ponies. But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you come back this way again.

WordCount: 27
Had they followed the pass, their path would have led them down the stream from the mountains that joined the great river miles south of the Carrock.

WordCount: 39
I should ride fast; for if they make their raid soon they will cross the river to the south and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and Wargs run swifter than ponies.

WordCount: 27
Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees.

WordCount: 29
As the light faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along in the same direction.

WordCount: 28
The land began to slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit that a silence began to draw in upon them. Birds began to sing less.

WordCount: 24
Their trunks were huge and gnarled, their branches twisted, their leaves were dark and long. Ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground.

WordCount: 28
The greatest of the forests of the Northern world. I hope you like the look of it. Now you must send back these excellent ponies you have borrowed.

WordCount: 30
Not only to guard you and guide you, but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn may be your friend, but he loves his animals as his children.

WordCount: 35
You do not guess what kindness he has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if you tried to take them into the forest.

WordCount: 30
Then they knew that Gandalf was going to leave them at the very edge of Mirkwood, and they were in despair. But nothing they could say would change his mind.

WordCount: 26
It is no use arguing. I have, as I told you, some pressing business away south; and I am already late through bothering with you people.

WordCount: 32
We may meet again before all is over, and then again of course we may not. That depends on your luck and on your courage and sense; and I am sending Mr.

WordCount: 25
Baggins with you. I have told you before that he has more about him than you guess, and you will find that out before long.

WordCount: 27
Company! This is your expedition after all. Think of the treasure at the end, and forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow morning!

WordCount: 25
It will get lighter all too soon. Before long I expect we shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food begins to run short.

WordCount: 24
Now Gandalf too said farewell. Bilbo sat on the ground feeling very unhappy and wishing he was beside the wizard on his tall horse.

WordCount: 33
You must either go through or give up your quest. And I am not going to allow you to back out now, Mr. Baggins. I am ashamed of you for thinking of it.

WordCount: 30
There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and twice that south. But you wouldn't get a safe path even then.

WordCount: 31
There are no safe paths in this part of the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go.

WordCount: 28
Long Marshes lying below you, and beyond them, high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting you.

WordCount: 24
Gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode down into the West. But he could not resist the temptation to have the last word.

WordCount: 24
There were none stretched across the path, but whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason they could not guess.

WordCount: 33
It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending.

WordCount: 33
But they had to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of wind on their faces.

WordCount: 32
And sometimes they would gleam down from the branches just above him; and that was most terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes.

WordCount: 26
All this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages; and he was always hungry, for they were extremely careful with their provisions.

WordCount: 25
Twelve yards! I should have thought it was thirty at least, but my eyes don't see as well as they used a hundred years ago.

WordCount: 35
I can't be sure in this light; but it looks to me as if it was just drawn up on the bank, which is low just there where the path goes down into the water.

WordCount: 25
Fili thought he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the direction, the others brought him a rope.

WordCount: 33
They had several with them, and on the end of the longest they fastened one of the large iron hooks they had used for catching their packs to the straps about their shoulders.

WordCount: 36
A couple of feet and you would have dropped it on to the boat. Try again. I don't suppose the magic is strong enough to hurt you, if you just touch a bit of wet rope.

WordCount: 24
Fili picked up the hook when he had drawn it back, rather doubtfully all the same. This time he threw it with greater strength.

WordCount: 34
It did. The rope went taut, and Fili pulled in vain. Kili came to his help, and then Oin and Gloin. They tugged and tugged, and suddenly they all fell over on their backs.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo was on the lockout, however, caught the rope, and with a piece of stick fended off the little black boat as it came rushing across the stream.

WordCount: 35
Fili and Balin. That's as many as the boat will hold at a time. After that Kili and Oin and Gloin and Don; next On and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur.

WordCount: 30
You should not be so fat. As you are, you must be with the last and lightest boatload. Don't start grumbling against orders, or something bad will happen to you.

WordCount: 35
One of the others must keep hold of the hook we used at first, and when we are safe on the other side he can hook it on, and you can draw the boat back.

WordCount: 34
High it sprang and cleared the water with a mighty jump. But it did not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was the only one who had kept his feet and his wits.

WordCount: 36
As soon as they had landed he had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat appeared. Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast.

WordCount: 26
As it reached the further bank it stumbled. The shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still.

WordCount: 24
Before they could shout in praise of the shot, however, a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds.

WordCount: 25
They could still see his hood above the water when they ran to the bank. Quickly they flung a rope with a hook towards him.

WordCount: 26
His hand caught it, and they pulled him to the shore. He was drenched from hair to boots, of course, but that was not the worst.

WordCount: 35
Then they all fell silent; and as they sat it seemed they could hear the noise of a great hunt going by to the north of the path, though they saw no sign of it.

WordCount: 38
There they sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. Bombur slept on with a smile on his fat face, as if he no longer cared for all the troubles that vexed them.

WordCount: 27
Suddenly on the path ahead appeared some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark. They glimmered in the shadows.

WordCount: 27
Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows from their bows. None seemed to find their mark.

WordCount: 24
The deer turned and vanished in the trees as silently as they had come, and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after them.

WordCount: 25
Thorin; but it was too late, the excited dwarves had wasted their last arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given them were useless.

WordCount: 24
They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change, for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep.

WordCount: 32
There was a breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on.

WordCount: 27
Their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the banks of the path from the deep red carpets of the forest.

WordCount: 22
Still Bombur slept and they grew very weary. At times they heard disquieting laughter. Sometimes there was singing in the distance too.

WordCount: 26
Two days later they found their path going downwards and before long they were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks.

WordCount: 34
Somebody must climb a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and have a look round. The only way is to choose the tallest tree that overhangs the path.

WordCount: 34
In the end he poked his head above the roof of leaves, and then he found spiders all right. But they were only small ones of ordinary size, and they were after the butterflies.

WordCount: 26
The forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! Whatever shall we do? And what is the use of sending a hobbit!

WordCount: 32
They did not care tuppence about the butterflies, and were only made more angry when he told them of the beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to climb up and feel.

WordCount: 33
The last thing that he remembered was the party at the hobbit's house, and they had great difficulty in making him believe their tale of all the many adventures they had had since.

WordCount: 31
A woodland king was there with a crown of leaves, and there was a merry singing, and I could not count or describe the things there were to eat and drink.

WordCount: 32
This they did all that day, going very slowly and wearily, while Bombur kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him and that he wanted to lie down and sleep.

WordCount: 26
They all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; then another and another sprang out beside it.

WordCount: 31
Bombur puffing up behind. He wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. But the others remembered only too well the warnings of the wizard and of Beorn.

WordCount: 28
After a good deal of creeping and crawling they peered round the trunks and looked into a clearing where some trees had been felled and the ground levelled.

WordCount: 34
No sooner had the first stepped into the clearing than all the lights went out as if by magic. Somebody kicked the fire and it went up in rockets of glittering sparks and vanished.

WordCount: 25
By that time they had, of course, quite forgotten in what direction the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at least till morning.

WordCount: 35
There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were; they did not even dare to search on the ground for scraps of food for fear of becoming separated again.

WordCount: 25
Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling lights, and they heard the voices and the laughter quite plainly.

WordCount: 26
No rushing forward this time! No one is to stir from hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them.

WordCount: 28
It was no good. Out went all the lights again and complete darkness fell. If it had been difficult collecting themselves before, it was far worse this time.

WordCount: 37
They were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. In the dark he fell over what he thought was a log, and he found it was the hobbit curled up fast asleep.

WordCount: 25
After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire to go nearer and try once more to get help.

WordCount: 28
Their gloaming hair was twined with flowers; green and white gems glinted on their collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with mirth.

WordCount: 24
Loud and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin into their midst. Dead silence fell in the middle of a word.

WordCount: 33
Out went all light. The fires leaped up in black smokes. Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves, and the wood was filled again with their clamour and their cries.

WordCount: 35
It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon he would not have been able to move at all. As it was, he had a desperate fight before he got free.

WordCount: 33
Somehow the killing of the giant spider, all alone by himself in the dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great difference to Mr.

WordCount: 32
Baggins. He felt a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put it back into its sheath.

WordCount: 34
Bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in what direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves.

WordCount: 31
Suddenly he saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above him, and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him.

WordCount: 28
Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing, but he could make out many of the words that they said. They were talking about the dwarves!

WordCount: 24
There was a muffled yelp inside, and a toe shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard. There was life in Bombur still.

WordCount: 29
There was a noise like the kicking of a flabby football, and the enraged spider fell off the branch, only catching itself with its own thread just in time.

WordCount: 31
I haven't had time to tell you about. There is no time now. While he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and soon he would have been dead.

WordCount: 31
At that moment Bilbo threw. The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs curled up.

WordCount: 25
The next stone went whizzing through a big web, snapping its cords, and taking off the spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead.

WordCount: 25
I can tell you. They could not see Bilbo, but they could make a good guess at the direction from which the stones were coming.

WordCount: 28
As quick as lightning they came running and swinging towards the hobbit, flinging out their long threads in all directions, till the air seemed full of waving snares.

WordCount: 25
Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can't see me! Attercop! Attercop! Won't you stop, Stop your spinning and look for me!

WordCount: 22
Old Tomnoddy, all big body, Old Tomnoddy can't spy me! Attercop! Attercop! Down you drop! You'll never catch me up your tree!

WordCount: 25
Not very good perhaps, but then you must remember that he had to make it up himself, on the spur of a very awkward moment.

WordCount: 36
Lazy Lob and crazy Cob are weaving webs to wind me. I am far more sweet than other meat, but still they cannot find me! Here am I, naughty little fly; you are fat and lazy.

WordCount: 27
In the meanwhile he had to rescue them. The worst part of the job was getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling.

WordCount: 35
Bilbo's next job was to loose a dwarf. What was he to do? If he cut the string which hung him up, the wretched dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a good way below.

WordCount: 31
He managed by leaning over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that bound him round, and then, sure enough, with a kick and a struggle most of Fili emerged.

WordCount: 28
It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of his eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he had to cut most of it off.

WordCount: 32
Well, between them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash them free. None of them were better off than Fili, and some of them were worse.

WordCount: 26
But there were still five dwarves hanging at the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back, more full of rage than ever.

WordCount: 29
Now we see you, you nasty little creature! We will eat you and leave your bones and skin hanging on a tree. Ugh! he's got a sting has he?

WordCount: 24
While this was going on, the other dwarves were working at the rest of the captives, and cutting at the threads with their knives.

WordCount: 34
Soon all would be free, though it was not clear what would happen after that. The spiders had caught them pretty easily the night before, but that had been unawares and in the dark.

WordCount: 34
He gave a shout and slashed at the spiders in front of him. They quickly gave way, and he scrambled and fell down the tree right into the middle of those on the ground.

WordCount: 28
His little sword was something new in the way of stings for them. How it darted to and fro! It shone with delight as he stabbed at them.

WordCount: 24
Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most of them very shaky and little use on their legs.

WordCount: 32
It looked pretty hopeless. Then the battle began. Some of the dwarves had knives, and some had sticks, and all of them could get at stones; and Bilbo had his elvish dagger.

WordCount: 22
Away behind them now the shouting and singing suddenly stopped. Hoping desperately that Bilbo had not been caught the dwarves went on.

WordCount: 30
Not fast enough, though. They were sick and weary, and they could not go much better than a hobble and a wobble, though many of the spiders were close behind.

WordCount: 20
Things were looking pretty bad again, when suddenly Bilbo appeared and charged into the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the side.

WordCount: 23
So curse as they would, their prey moved slowly but steadily away. It was a most terrible business, and seemed to take hours.

WordCount: 33
Whether it was one of those they had seen the night before, they could not tell. But it seemed that some good magic lingered in such spots, which the spiders did not like.

WordCount: 25
At any rate here the light was greener, and the boughs less thick and threatening, and they had a chance to rest and draw breath.

WordCount: 23
Balin in particular insisted on having the Gollum story, riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring in its proper place.

WordCount: 23
These questions they asked over and over again, and it was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the answers.

WordCount: 32
Some of them even got up and bowed right to the ground before him, though they fell over with the effort, and could not get on their legs again for some time.

WordCount: 26
But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them Were fit to go and look for anything, or to search for the lost path.

WordCount: 24
Bilbo's tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at the endless trees; and after a while they all fell silent again.

WordCount: 22
All except Balin. Long after the others had stopped talking and shut their eyes, he kept on muttering and chuckling to himself.

WordCount: 24
Gollum! Well I'm blest! So that's how he sneaked past me is it? Now I know! Just crept quietly along did you, Mr. Baggins?

WordCount: 27
And then he fell asleep, and there was complete silence for a long time. All of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye, and looked round at them.

WordCount: 22
It was a terrible shock. Of course there were only thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the hobbit. Where indeed was Thorin?

WordCount: 26
Thorin had been caught much faster than they had. You remember Bilbo falling like a log into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light?

WordCount: 27
These are not wicked folk. If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their magic was strong, even in those days they were wary.

WordCount: 27
In fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, and had houses or huts on the ground and in the branches.

WordCount: 28
The beeches were their favourite trees. The king's cave was his palace, and the strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of his people against their enemies.

WordCount: 26
The king looked sternly on Thorin, when he was brought before him, and asked him many questions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving.

WordCount: 29
It was not very long before he discovered; but that belongs to the next chapter and the beginning of another adventure in which the hobbit again showed his usefulness.

WordCount: 33
Barrels Out of Bond The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last despairing effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst.

WordCount: 36
They got up and staggered on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out if they were right.

WordCount: 35
Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into the blackness of night, when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all round them, like hundreds of red stars.

WordCount: 32
Bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the torches, for the elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and weary as they were.

WordCount: 29
The king had ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross the bridge.

WordCount: 31
There the great beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were in the stream. Across this bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear.

WordCount: 38
In a great hall with pillars hewn out of the living stone sat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries and red leaves, for the autumn was come again.

WordCount: 35
Is it a crime to be lost in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be trapped by spiders? Are the spiders your tame beasts or your pets, if killing them makes you angry?

WordCount: 27
It is a crime to wander in my realm without leave. Do you forget that you were in my kingdom, using the road that my people made?

WordCount: 37
And when he did go out, which was not very often, he did no good. He did not wish to desert the dwarves, and indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them.

WordCount: 36
He was hungry too outside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up a living of some sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand.

WordCount: 25
He found all their twelve cells in different parts of the palace, and after a time he got to know his way about very well.

WordCount: 30
What was his surprise one day to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that there was another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark place.

WordCount: 23
Bilbo. Just what Gandalf had said would happen, you see. Perhaps that war part of his reason for going off and leaving them.

WordCount: 29
Bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did. He did not like being depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand.

WordCount: 27
But of course, as you have guessed, he did rescue his friends in the end, and this is how it happened. One day, nosing and wandering about.

WordCount: 34
A stream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the palace, and joined the Forest River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of which the main mouth opened.

WordCount: 37
There the rocky roof came down close to the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that way.

WordCount: 25
The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands.

WordCount: 26
Forest River. Often they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the stream; sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats.

WordCount: 29
I'll taste with you, and see if it is fit for the king's table. There is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up poor stuff!

WordCount: 30
When he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with him and he had a chance at once to try his desperate plan.

WordCount: 24
He followed the two elves, until they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which two large flagons were set.

WordCount: 25
Dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his servants, but for the king's feasts only, and for smaller bowls, not for the butler's great flagons.

WordCount: 27
You must follow me! We must all keep together and not risk getting separated. All of us must escape or none, and this is our last chance.

WordCount: 30
If this is found out, goodness knows where the king will put you next, with chains on your hands and feet too, I expect. Don't argue, there's a good fellow!

WordCount: 30
But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in the woods that night, and in the halls above.

WordCount: 30
Nearly all the king's folks were merrymaking. At last after much blundering they came to Thorin's dungeon, far down in a deep place and fortunately not far from the cellars.

WordCount: 32
Gandalf spoke true, as usual. A pretty fine burglar you make, it seems, when the time comes. I am sure we are all for ever at your service, whatever happens after this.

WordCount: 30
Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he did not feel at all sure bow the dwarves would take it.

WordCount: 35
He wasn't a bad fellow, and quite decent to the prisoners. It will puzzle them all too. They will think we had a very strong magic to pass through all those locked doors and disappear.

WordCount: 27
Balin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they stirred. The rest went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors.

WordCount: 33
There was little time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some elves were under orders to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into the stream.

WordCount: 25
But among them were several others which had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king's palace.

WordCount: 24
Here's the old villain with his head on a jug! He's been having a little feast all to himself and his friend the captain.

WordCount: 27
Here am I waiting and waiting down here, while you fellows drink and make merry and forget your tasks. Small wonder if I fall asleep from weariness!

WordCount: 24
For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at once, he had precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again.

WordCount: 23
Follow, follow stars that leap Up the heavens cold and steep; Turn when dawn comes over land, Over rapid, over sand, South away!

WordCount: 35
Back to gardens on the hills Where the berry swells and fills Under sunlight, under day! South away! and South away! Down the swift dark stream you go Back to lands you once did know!

WordCount: 35
Now the very last barrel was being rolled to the doors! In despair and not knowing what else to do, poor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was pushed over the edge with it.

WordCount: 23
Every time he tried, the barrel rolled round and ducked him under again. It was really empty, and floated light as a cork.

WordCount: 32
Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar above. Then suddenly the trapdoors fell to with a boom and their voices faded away.

WordCount: 31
Out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank. Bilbo wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting into their tubs.

WordCount: 25
Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside.

WordCount: 25
The breeze was cold but better than the water, and he hoped he would not suddenly roll off again when they started off once more.

WordCount: 25
Luckily he was very light, and the barrel was a good big one and being rather leaky had now shipped a small amount of water.

WordCount: 27
In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner. He could see the paler sky between them.

WordCount: 28
The dark river opened suddenly wide, and there it was joined to the main water of the Forest River flowing down in haste from the king's great doors.

WordCount: 26
There was a dim sheet of water no longer overshadowed, and on its sliding surface there were dancing and broken reflections of clouds and of stars.

WordCount: 30
Then the hurrying water of the Forest River swept all the company of casks and tubs away to the north bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay.

WordCount: 28
They quickly poled and pushed all the barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted them they roped them together and left them till the morning.

WordCount: 32
Poor dwarves! Bilbo was not so badly off now. He slipped from his barrel and waded ashore, and then sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the water's edge.

WordCount: 29
Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees, and that appealed to him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.

WordCount: 37
Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside; but Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him.

WordCount: 26
Luckily there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good while.

WordCount: 28
There was a mighty pushing of poles. The elves that were standing in the shallow .water heaved and shoved. The barrels now all lashed together creaked and fretted.

WordCount: 30
A Warm Welcome The day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the river rounded a steep shoulder of land that came down upon their left.

WordCount: 21
Under its rocky feet like an inland cliff the deepest stream had flowed lapping and bubbling. Suddenly the cliff fell away.

WordCount: 26
East and the tumbled land that joined it to them could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked across the marshes to the forest.

WordCount: 27
The Lonely Mountain! Bilbo had come far and through many adventures to see it, and now he did not like the look of it in the least.

WordCount: 32
The marshes and bogs had spread wider and wider on either side. Paths had vanished, and many a rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost ways across.

WordCount: 24
Long Lake. There it had a wide mouth with stony clifflike gates at either side whose feet were piled with shingles. The Long Lake!

WordCount: 27
They would have been surprised, if they could have seen what happened down by the shore, after they had gone and the shades of night had fallen.

WordCount: 28
First of all a barrel was cut loose by Bilbo and pushed to the shore and opened. Groans came from inside, and out crept a most unhappy dwarf.

WordCount: 33
Wet straw was in his draggled beard; he was so sore and stiff, so bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand or stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore.

WordCount: 35
Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy, and it was no good asking them to help. Bifur and Bofur were less knocked about and drier, but they lay down and would do nothing.

WordCount: 24
My tub was full of it. To smell apples everlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and sick with hunger is maddening.

WordCount: 23
With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of the company and got them out.

WordCount: 33
And I suppose we ought to thank our stars and Mr. Baggins. I am sure he has a right to expect it, though I wish he could have arranged a more comfortable journey.

WordCount: 27
Nothing else could, of course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili and Kili and the hobbit went along the shore to the great bridge.

WordCount: 28
There were guards at the head of it, but they were not keeping very careful watch, for it was so long since there had been any real need.

WordCount: 29
We have no need of weapons, who return at last to our own as spoken of old. Nor could we fight against so many. Take us to your master!

WordCount: 34
We are worn and famished after our long road and we have sick comrades. Now make haste and let us have no more words, or your master may have something to say to you.

WordCount: 32
From one great hall shone many lights and there came the sound of many voices. They passed its doors and stood blinking in the light looking at long tables filled with folk.

WordCount: 29
Thorin in a loud voice from the door, before the captain could say anything. All leaped to their feet. The Master of the town sprang from his great chair.

WordCount: 29
These are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through the woods and molesting our people!

WordCount: 28
Master. As a matter of fact he thought it far more likely than the return of the King under the Mountain, if any such person had ever existed.

WordCount: 30
Others were of different mind, however, and quickly the matter was settled without him. The news had spread from the doors of the hall like fire through all the town.

WordCount: 34
Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over the lake. The King beneath the mountains, The King of carven stone, The lord of silver fountains Shall come into his own!

WordCount: 22
The woods shall wave on mountains And grass beneath the sun; His wealth shall flow in fountains And the rivers golden run.

WordCount: 35
So they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of it, and there was much shouting as well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up with it.

WordCount: 23
They did not know of course how Thorin had escaped, and they began to think their king might have made a serious mistake.

WordCount: 35
As for the Master he saw there was nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said.

WordCount: 31
These were inspired largely by the Master and they did not particularly please the dwarves, but in the meantime they were well contented and they quickly grew fat and strong again.

WordCount: 25
Indeed within a week they were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of their proper colours, with beards combed and trimmed, and proud steps.

WordCount: 29
Forest River with their cargoes, and there was great excitement in the king's palace. I have never heard what happened to the chief of the guards and the butler.

WordCount: 26
Bilbo was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery.

WordCount: 35
Very well! We'll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood without my having something to say in the matter. But I expect they will all come to a bad end, and serve them right!

WordCount: 24
He sent out his spies about the shores of the lake and as far northward towards the Mountains as they would go, and waited.

WordCount: 26
At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to think of departure. While the enthusiasm still lasted in the town was the time to get help.

WordCount: 34
It would not do to let everything cool down with delay. So he spoke to the Master and his councillors and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the Mountain.

WordCount: 28
Then for the first time the Master was surprised and a little frightened; and he wondered if Thorin was after all really a descendant of the old kings.

WordCount: 29
He had never thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach Smaug, but believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be discovered and be turned out.

WordCount: 34
But the Master was not sorry at all to let them go. They were expensive to keep, and their arrival had turned things into a long holiday in which business was at a standstill.

WordCount: 32
You must claim your own. The hour is at hand, spoken of old. What help we can offer shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is regained.

WordCount: 31
People sang on the quays and out of windows. The white oars dipped and splashed, and off they went north up the lake on the last stage of their long journey.

WordCount: 31
The stream was strong and their going slow. At the; end of the third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or western bank and disembarked.

WordCount: 26
Here they were joined by the horses with other provisions and necessaries and the ponies for their own use that had been sent to meet them.

WordCount: 36
It was easier to believe in the Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild parts. Indeed their stores had no need of any guard, for all the land was desolate and empty.

WordCount: 22
So their escort left them, making off swiftly down the river and the shoreward paths, although the night was already drawing on.

WordCount: 22
River Running, and drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Mountain that was flung out southwards towards them.

WordCount: 25
There was little grass, and before long there was neither bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished.

WordCount: 28
For this purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They marched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill.

WordCount: 27
There the river, after winding a wide loop over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the Lake, flowing swift and noisily.

WordCount: 25
The mountain's sides were green with woods and all the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in the days when the bells rang in that town.

WordCount: 33
They were alone in the perilous waste without hope of further help. They were at the end of their journey, but as far as ever, it seemed, from the end of their quest.

WordCount: 30
If the map was true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley's head must stand the secret door. Day by day they came back to their camp without success.

WordCount: 33
But at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking. Fili and Kili and the hobbit went back one day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its southern corner.

WordCount: 23
About midday, creeping behind a great stone that stood alone like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like rough steps going upwards.

WordCount: 27
Looking down they saw that they were at the top of the cliff at the valley's head and were gazing down on to their own camp below.

WordCount: 26
They beat on it, they thrust and pushed at it, they implored it to move, they spoke fragments of broken spells of opening, and nothing stirred.

WordCount: 29
At last tired out they. rested on the grass at its feet, and then at evening began, their long climb down. There was excitement in the camp that night.

WordCount: 32
In the morning they prepared to move once more. Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies and such stores as they had brought with them from the river.

WordCount: 26
I should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.

WordCount: 36
Out up there a silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in the crannies of stone. They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every rock.

WordCount: 23
But when they struck the stone the handles splintered and jarred their arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like lead.

WordCount: 25
Mining work, they saw clearly was no good against the magic that had shut this door; and they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise.

WordCount: 22
Mirkwood, and to the distances beyond, in which he sometimes thought he could catch glimpses of the Misty Mountains small and far.

WordCount: 23
You said sitting on the doorstep and thinking would be my job, not to mention getting inside, so I am sitting and thinking.

WordCount: 38
If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest. As the sun turned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light caught the last pale leaves.

WordCount: 36
Soon he saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards the level of his eyes. He went to the opening and there pale and faint was a thin new moon above the rim of Earth.

WordCount: 33
At that very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled dark spots.

WordCount: 30
The sun sank lower and lower, and their hopes fell. It sank into a belt of reddened cloud and disappeared. The dwarves groaned, but still Bilbo stood almost without moving.

WordCount: 35
The little moon was dipping to the horizon. Evening was coming on. Then suddenly when their hope was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a finger through a rent in the cloud.

WordCount: 24
The old thrush, who had been watching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on one side, gave a sudden trill.

WordCount: 25
There was a loud attack. A flake of rock split from the wall and fell. A hole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground.

WordCount: 26
Then Thorin stepped up and drew the key on its chain from round his neck. He put it to the hole. It fitted and it turned!

WordCount: 29
You are familiar with Thorin's style on important occasions, so I will not give you any more of it, though he went on a good deal longer than this.

WordCount: 27
It certainly was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what be was driving at.

WordCount: 29
I might refuse. I have got you out of two messes already, which were hardly in the original bargain, so that I am, I think, already owed some reward.

WordCount: 31
Then the hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than hobbit's care to make no sound, he crept noiselessly down, down, down into the dark.

WordCount: 36
You went and put your foot right in it that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was and am!

WordCount: 27
He did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door behind had faded away. He was altogether alone.

WordCount: 27
It was. As he went forward it grew and grew, till there was no doubt about it. It was a red light steadily getting redder and redder.

WordCount: 25
This grew to the unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him.

WordCount: 30
Mountain's root. It is almost dark so that its vastaess can only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there is a great glow.

WordCount: 30
His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed motionless, almost forgetting the frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count.

WordCount: 33
He gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole from the shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of treasure.

WordCount: 30
Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he was surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried him out into the open air.

WordCount: 26
Then the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment before and cowered down in fright. Smaug was still to be reckoned with.

WordCount: 27
Of late he had half fancied he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above that came down through it to his lair.

WordCount: 30
He stirred and stretched forth his neck to sniff. Then he missed the cup! Thieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing had not happened since first he came to the Mountain!

WordCount: 23
Up came Bofur, and still all was safe. Up came Bombur, puffing and blowing while the ropes creaked, and still all was safe.

WordCount: 28
Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and then danger was upon them. A whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points of standing rocks.

WordCount: 25
His hot breath shrivelled the grass before the door, and drove in through the crack they had left and scorched them as they lay hid.

WordCount: 30
Then darkness fell as he passed again. The ponies screamed with terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. The dragon swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone.

WordCount: 36
Nothing can escape Smaug once he sees it. Here we are and here we shall have to stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back to the river with Smaug on the watch!

WordCount: 34
It was not a pleasant thought! They crept further down the tunnel, and there they lay and shivered though it was warm and stuffy, until dawn came pale through the crack of the door.

WordCount: 24
He would not forget or forgive the theft, not if a thousand years turned him to smouldering stone, but he could afford to wait.

WordCount: 24
Slow and silent he crept back to his lair and half closed his eyes. When morning came the terror of the dwarves grew less.

WordCount: 26
They realized that dangers of this kind were inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that it was no good giving up their quest yet.

WordCount: 25
If there is any grumbling to be done, I think I might have a say. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not one.

WordCount: 37
That obviously depends entirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of Smaug. Getting rid of dragons is not at all in my line, but I will do my best to think about it.

WordCount: 33
Well, if you really want my advice, I should say we can do nothing but stay where we are. By day we can no doubt creep out safely enough to take the air.

WordCount: 27
Perhaps something will turn up. 'Every worm has his weak spot,' as my father used to say, though I am sure it was not from personal experience.

WordCount: 25
Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly. Already they had come to respect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in their adventure.

WordCount: 24
He had begun to have ideas and plans of his own. When midday came he got ready for another journey down into the Mountain.

WordCount: 30
The sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the tunnel. The light from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down.

WordCount: 34
So silent was his going that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpasses it, and he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as he drew near the lower door.

WordCount: 33
He had forgotten or had never heard about dragons' sense of smell. It is also an awkward fact that they keep half an eye open watching while they sleep, if they are suspicious.

WordCount: 34
Bilbo peeped once more from the entrance. He was just about to step out on to the floor when he caught a sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under the drooping lid.

WordCount: 26
Smaug's left eye. He was only pretending to sleep! He was watching the tunnel entrance! Hurriedly Bilbo stepped back and blessed the luck of his ring.

WordCount: 25
Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along! Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!

WordCount: 31
I did not come for presents. I only wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great as tales say. I did not believe them.

WordCount: 27
You seem familiar with my name, but I don't seem to remember smelling you before. Who are you and where do you come from, may I ask?

WordCount: 29
You may indeed! I come from under the hill, and under hills and over the hills my paths led. And through the air, I am he that walks unseen.

WordCount: 33
I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me.

WordCount: 26
Maybe Barrel was your pony's name; and maybe not, though it was fat enough. You may walk unseen, but you did not walk all the way.

WordCount: 29
Why not say 'us fourteen' and be done with it. Mr. Lucky Number? I am pleased to hear that you had other business in these parts besides my gold.

WordCount: 29
Not much use in the forest? Bless me! Had you never thought of the catch? A fourteenth share, I suppose, Or something like it, those were the terms, eh?

WordCount: 31
We came over hill and under hill, by wave and win, for Revenge. Surely, O Smaug the unassessably wealthy, you must realize that your success has made you some bitter enemies?

WordCount: 28
Bilbo to the floor, while far up in the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and imagined that the hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end.

WordCount: 32
I kill where I wish and none dare resist. I laid low the warriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender.

WordCount: 22
Truly there can; nowhere be found the equal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!

WordCount: 25
He had been feeling rather pleased with the cleverness of his conversation with Smaug, but his mistake at the end shook him into better sense.

WordCount: 28
The Men of Dale used to have the trick of understanding their language, and used them for messengers to fly to the Men of the Lake and elsewhere.

WordCount: 33
So Bilbo told them all he could remember, and he confessed that he had a nasty feeling that the dragon guessed too much from his riddles added to the camps and the ponies.

WordCount: 26
All the while they talked the thrush listened, till at last when the stars began to peep forth, it silently spread its wings and flew away.

WordCount: 24
And all the while they talked and the shadows lengthened Bilbo became more and more unhappy and his foreboding At last he interrupted them.

WordCount: 26
I don't see the point of sitting here. The dragon has withered all the pleasant green, and anyway the night has come and it is cold.

WordCount: 39
But I feel it in my bones that this place will be attacked again. Smaug knows now how I came down to his hall, and you can trust him to guess where the other end of the tunnel is.

WordCount: 31
He will break all this side of the Mountain to bits, if necessary, to stop up our entrance, and if we are smashed with it the better he will like it.

WordCount: 27
Why has not Smaug blocked the lower end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? He has not, or we should have heard him.

WordCount: 30
I wish you would not argue. Smaug will be coming out at any minute now, and our only hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the door.

WordCount: 28
From that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin and Balin remembered. They wondered if they were still lying there .

WordCount: 29
But fairest of all was the great white gem, which the dwarves had found beneath the roots of the Mountain, the Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain.

WordCount: 31
It was like a globe with a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under the stars, like rain upon the Moon!

WordCount: 27
I fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less than the uproar of last night. Shut the door before it is too late!

WordCount: 28
Something in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly Thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged the door.

WordCount: 31
Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. No trace of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in the Mountain!

WordCount: 29
I don't like to think. They fled further down the tunnel glad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and rumble of Smaug's fury.

WordCount: 24
This was the outburst of his wrath when he could find nobody and see nothing, even where he guessed the outlet must actually be.

WordCount: 29
After he had let off his rage in this way he felt better and he thought in his heart that he would not be troubled again from that direction.

WordCount: 37
Your fee came from the waterside and up the water you came with out a doubt. I don't know your smell, but if you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had their help.

WordCount: 24
Not at Home In the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about them. Little they ate and little they spoke.

WordCount: 26
They could not count the passing of time; and they scarcely dared to move, for the whisper of their voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel.

WordCount: 30
They would almost have welcomed sounds from below of the dragon's return. In the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his, but they could not sit there for ever.

WordCount: 27
I must feel the wind on my face soon or die. I think I would rather be smashed by Smaug in the open than suffocate in here!

WordCount: 34
So several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been. But they found that the upper end of the tunnel had been shattered and blocked with broken rock.

WordCount: 28
But somehow, just when the dwarves were most despairing, Bilbo felt a strange lightening of the heart, as if a heavy weight had gone from under his waistcoat.

WordCount: 28
In fact so black was it that the hobbit came to the opening unexpectedly, put his hand on air, stumbled for ward, and rolled headlong into the hall!

WordCount: 27
Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. Bilbo got up, and found that he did not know in what direction to turn.

WordCount: 35
The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at the end the tunnel.

WordCount: 37
Gloin with a bundle of others under his arm. Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch; but he could not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet.

WordCount: 25
As Thorin carefully explained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator. If he liked to risk a light, that was his affair.

WordCount: 35
They would wait in the tunnel for his report. So they sat near the door and watched. They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding his tiny light aloft.

WordCount: 29
The light grew smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall; then it began to rise dancing into the air. Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure.

WordCount: 27
Soon he stood upon the top, and still went on. Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; but they did not know the reason.

WordCount: 27
Ever as he climbed, the same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards Slowly it grew to a little globe of pallid light.

WordCount: 27
Now as came near, it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of man colours at the surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of his torch.

WordCount: 31
All the same he had an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not really been meant to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble would yet come of it.

WordCount: 29
Now he went on again. Down the other side of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves.

WordCount: 24
He peeped timidly through and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of wide stairs going up into the gloom.

WordCount: 30
And still there was no sight nor sound of Smaug. He was just going to turn and go back, when a black shape swooped at him and brushed his face.

WordCount: 24
For the moment his courage had failed together. Faintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they could catch was 'help!

WordCount: 24
Gloin lit several more torches, and then they all crept out, one by one, and went along the wall as hurriedly as they could.

WordCount: 27
It was not long before they met Bilbo himself coming back towards them. His wits had quickly returned soon as he saw the twinkle of their lights.

WordCount: 34
The dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. All were now eager to explore the hall while they had the chance, and willing to believe that, for the present, Smaug was away from home.

WordCount: 24
Each now gripped a lighted torch; and as they gazed, first on one side and then on another, they forgot fear and even caution.

WordCount: 31
They spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as they lifted old treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light caressing and fingering them.

WordCount: 27
It was the Arkenstone but he spoke of it yet to no one. Now the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and armed themselves.

WordCount: 26
A light helm of figured leather, strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and studded about the bring with white gems, was set upon the hobbit's head.

WordCount: 25
What next? We are armed, but what good has any armour ever been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This treasure is not yet won back.

WordCount: 30
Then he hailed the others, and they gathered together, and holding their torches above their heads they passed through the gaping doors, not without many a backward glance of longing.

WordCount: 25
They climbed long stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing ways, and turned again and climbed yet more stairs, and yet more' stairs again.

WordCount: 20
They passed through the ruined chamber. Tables were rotting there; chairs and benches were lying there overturned, charred and decaying.

WordCount: 27
As they came through yet more doors at the further end, a sound of water fell upon their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly more full.

WordCount: 35
Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there issued a boiling water, and it flowed swirling in a narrow channel, carved and made straight and deep by the cunning of ancient hands.

WordCount: 24
In front there rose a tall arch, still showing the fragments of old carven work within, worn and splintered and blackened though it was.

WordCount: 24
A misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of the Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold.

WordCount: 29
Now before them the water fell noisily outward and foamed down towards the valley. They flung their pale torches to the ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled eyes.

WordCount: 31
I never expected to be looking out of this door. And I never expected to be so pleased to see the sun again, and to feel the wind on my face.

WordCount: 31
It was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter. It swirled over and round the arms of the Mountain into the valley, and sighed among the rocks.

WordCount: 27
But I don't feel that Smaug's front doorstep is the safest place for a meal. Do let's go somewhere where we can sit quiet for a bit!

WordCount: 27
Five hours march, I should think. It will be rough going. The road from the Gate along the left edge of the stream seems all broken up.

WordCount: 24
More walking and more climbing without breakfast! I wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals, we have missed inside that nasty clockless, timeless hole?

WordCount: 27
In the meanwhile where is he? I would give a good breakfast to know. I hope he is not up on the Mountain looking down at us!

WordCount: 30
Here they found a flat place without a wall on three sides, but backed to the North by a rocky face in which there was an opening like a door.

WordCount: 25
Dori, who was always looking up towards the Mountain's peak, as if he expected to see Smaug perched there like a bird on a steeple.

WordCount: 36
Fire and Water Now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, you must go back again to the evening when he smashed the door and flew off in rage, two days before.

WordCount: 33
From their town the Lonely Mountain was mostly screened by the low hills at the far end of the lake, through a gap in which the Running River came down from the North.

WordCount: 28
Only its high peak could they see in clear weather, and they looked seldom at it, for it was ominous and dreary even in the light of morning.

WordCount: 21
The lights again! Last night the watchmen saw them start and fade from midnight until dawn. Something is happening up there.

WordCount: 23
His wealth is like the Sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden run! The river is running gold from the Mountain!

WordCount: 22
Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores. The cheering stopped and the joy was turned to dread.

WordCount: 33
Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. Back swirled the dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of the Great House crumbled and smashed down.

WordCount: 25
Now men cursed their names. The Master himself was turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the confusion and save himself.

WordCount: 31
Soon all the town would be deserted and burned down to the surface of the lake. That was the dragon's hope. They could all get into boats for all he cared.

WordCount: 27
There he could have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop till they starved. Let them try to get to land and he would be ready.

WordCount: 27
He was a descendant in long line of Girion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down the Running River from the ruin long ago.

WordCount: 26
Now he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows but one were spent. The flames were near him. His companions were leaving him.

WordCount: 27
Unafraid it perched by his ear and it brought him news. Marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for he was of the race of Dale.

WordCount: 23
The dragon was circling back, flying low, and as he came the moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered his great wings.

WordCount: 31
Black arrow! I have saved you to the last. You have never failed me and always I have recovered you. I had you from my father and he from of old.

WordCount: 26
The great bow twanged. The black arrow sped straight from the string, straight for the hollow by the left breast where the foreleg was flung wide.

WordCount: 32
Full on the town he fell. His last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes. The lake roared in. A vast steam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under the moon.

WordCount: 37
There was a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then silence. And that was the end of Smaug and Esgaroth, but not of Bard. The waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and cold.

WordCount: 28
It twisted the white fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove it off to the West to scatter in tattered shreds over the marshes before Mirkwood.

WordCount: 24
He has tonight earned an eminent place in the roll of the benefactors of our town; and he is worthy of many imperishable songs.

WordCount: 29
Then even as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the fabled treasure of the Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent.

WordCount: 38
Then he strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of the sick and the wounded. But the Master scowled at his back as he went, and remained sitting on the ground.

WordCount: 25
The Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds that loved his folk, and already knew much of what had happened.

WordCount: 22
Very great indeed was the commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the Dragon.

WordCount: 31
He had not boats or rafts enough for his host, and they were forced to go the slower way by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead by water.

WordCount: 30
Forest and the Lake, their going was swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon the shores and looked on the ruins of the town.

WordCount: 25
But all the men of arms who were still able, and the most of the Elvenking's array, got ready to march north to the Mountain.

WordCount: 35
The Gathering of the Clouds Now we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All night one of them had watched, but when morning came they had not heard or seen any sign of danger.

WordCount: 30
But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were wheeling and crying unceasingly above.

WordCount: 24
He was an aged raven of great size. He alighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly flapped his wings, and bobbed towards Thorin.

WordCount: 28
Behold! the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale from South and East and West, for word has gone out that Smaug is dead!

WordCount: 27
Your own wisdom must decide your course, but thirteen is small remnant of the great folk of Durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far.

WordCount: 30
Our thanks, Róac Carc's son. You and your people shall not be forgotten. But none of our gold shall thieves take or the violent carry off while we are alive.

WordCount: 28
Smaug, and no sign of them remained. So now they began to labour hard in fortifying the main entrance, and in remaking the road that led from it.

WordCount: 28
Tools were to be found in plenty that the miners and quarriers and builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were still very skilled.

WordCount: 30
As they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. In this way they learned that the Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and they still had a breathing space.

WordCount: 28
Dale. Approach to the Gate was now only possible, without swimming, along a narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right as one looked outwards from the wall.

WordCount: 25
But they answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, and the others after gazing for a while at the Gate and its defences soon followed them.

WordCount: 34
That day the camp was moved and was brought right between the arms of the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day.

WordCount: 28
Under the Mountain dark and tall The King has come unto his hall! His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread, And ever so his foes shall fall.

WordCount: 30
The sword is sharp, the spear is long, The arrow swift, the Gate is strong; The heart is bold that looks on gold; The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.

WordCount: 26
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells In places deep, where dark things sleep, In hollow halls beneath the fells.

WordCount: 23
The melody of harps they wrung. The mountain throne once more is freed! O! wandering folk, the summons heed! Come haste! Come haste!

WordCount: 36
His hands are rich with gems and gold. The king is come unto his hall Under the Mountain dark and tall. The Worm of Dread is slain and dead, And ever so our foes shall fall!

WordCount: 28
Hail Thorin! Why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We are not yet foes, and we rejoice that you are alive beyond our hope.

WordCount: 33
Is not that a matter of which we may speak? Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men of Esgaroth, and I am yet the servant of their Master.

WordCount: 26
Now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought that Thorin would at once admit what justice was in them.

WordCount: 35
He did not, of course, expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon's weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did.

WordCount: 30
But nothing will we give, not even a loaf's worth, under threat of force. While an armed host lies before our doors, we look on you as foes and thieves.

WordCount: 28
It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to our kindred, had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain.

WordCount: 29
But you are not dead, and we are not robbers. Moreover the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy that befriended them when they were in want.

WordCount: 29
I will not parley, as I have said, with armed men at my gate. Nor at all with the people of the Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness.

WordCount: 28
Thorin Thrain's son Oakenshield, calling himself the King under the Mountain, and we bid him consider well the claims that have been urged, or be declared our foe.

WordCount: 37
I declare the Mountain besieged. You shall not depart from it, until you call on your side for a truce and a parley. We will bear no weapons against you, but we leave you to your gold.

WordCount: 29
All the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his little head.

WordCount: 22
Winter and snow is hastening behind them. How shall you be fed without the friendship and goodwill of the lands about you?

WordCount: 23
Waste grievous to bear. With my friends behind them and winter upon them, they will perhaps be in softer mood to parley with.

WordCount: 30
Then he climbed to the top of the wall. Only Bombur was there, for it was his turn to watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time.

WordCount: 28
A sorry business altogether. Not that I venture to disagree with Thorin, may his beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff neck.

WordCount: 29
I can't give you those, while the siege is going on. But it is long since I watched, and I will take your turn for you, if you like.

WordCount: 26
You are a good fellow, Mr. Baggins, and I will take your offer kindly. If there should be anything to note, rouse me first, mind you!

WordCount: 29
As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on his ring, fastened his rope, slipped down over the wall, and was gone. He had about five hours before him.

WordCount: 29
There is a spy about. Hide your lights! They will help him more than us, if it is that queer little creature that is said to be their servant.

WordCount: 36
Thorin, if you want to know. I know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't know me to look at. But Bard will remember me, and it is Bard I particularly want to see.

WordCount: 31
I am aware of that. Personally I am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully, and deduct what is right from the total before putting in my own claim.

WordCount: 34
However you don't know Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, he is quite ready to sit on a heap of gold and starve, as long as you sit here.

WordCount: 27
Don't be so hasty! I never met such suspicious folk! I am merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. Now I will make you an offer!

WordCount: 23
Arkenstone, and threw away the wrapping. The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty, stood up in amazement.

WordCount: 33
Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It was as if a globe had been filled with moonlight and hung before them in a net woven of the glint of frosty stars.

WordCount: 32
Heart of the Mountain; and it is also the heart of Thorin. He values it above a river of gold. I give it to you. It will aid you in your bargaining.

WordCount: 28
Then Bilbo, not without a shudder, not without a glance of longing, handed the marvellous stone to Bard, and he held it in his hand, as though dazed.

WordCount: 33
I am an honest one, I hope, more or less. Anyway I am going back now, and the dwarves can do what they like to me. I hope you will find it useful.

WordCount: 29
But I don't think I ought to leave my friends like this, after all we have gone through together. And I promised to wake old Bombur at midnight, too!

WordCount: 27
Nothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him, and as he went both the king and Bard saluted him with honour.

WordCount: 30
It was Gandalf. For the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was no time for all the questions that he immediately wished to ask.

WordCount: 26
Things are drawing towards the end now, unless I am mistaken. There is an unpleasant time just in front of you; but keep your heart up!

WordCount: 32
Puzzled but cheered. Bilbo hurried on. He was guided to a safe ford and set across dry, and then he said farewell to the elves and climbed carefully back towards the Gate.

WordCount: 23
He was soon fast asleep forgetting all his worries till the morning. As matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon.

WordCount: 23
The Clouds Burst Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp. Soon a single runner was seen hurrying along the narrow path.

WordCount: 28
At a distance he stood and hailed them, asking whether Thorin would now listen to another embassy, since new tidings had come to hand, and matters were changed.

WordCount: 23
About midday the banners of the Forest and the Lake were seen to be borne forth again. A company of twenty was approaching.

WordCount: 21
The light leapt from his hand, bright and white in the morning. Then Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion.

WordCount: 32
By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his choice of you! May his beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!

WordCount: 31
Here is Gandalf! And none too soon it seems. If you don't like my Burglar, please don't damage him. Put him down, and listen first to what he has to say!

WordCount: 36
The time was, all the same, when you seemed to think that I had been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is this ail the service of you and your family that I was promised.

WordCount: 26
And so Bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all his trouble, except the armour which Thorin had given him already.

WordCount: 35
You have mail upon you, which was made by my folk, and is too good for you. It cannot be pierced .by arrows; but if you do not hasten, I will sting your miserable feet.

WordCount: 30
We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will return, and see if you have brought from the hoard the portion that is to be set against the stone.

WordCount: 27
With that they went back to the camp; but Thorin sent messengers by Róac telling Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed.

WordCount: 33
That day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air was dark and gloomy. The morning was still early when a cry was heard in the camp.

WordCount: 25
Runners came in to report that a host of dwarves had appeared round the eastern spur of the Mountain and was now hastening to Dale.

WordCount: 27
Their beards were forked and plaited and thrust into their belts. Their caps were of iron and they were shod with iron, and their faces were grim.

WordCount: 33
We are hastening to our kinsmen in the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old is renewed. But who are you that sit in the plain as foes before defended walls?

WordCount: 26
They meant to push on between the Mountain and the loop of the river, for the narrow land there did not seem to be strongly guarded.

WordCount: 24
They would stand a siege for weeks, and by that time yet more dwarves might come, and yet more, for Thorin had many relatives.

WordCount: 31
Also they would be able to reopen and guard some other gate, so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they had not sufficient numbers.

WordCount: 32
Bard then sent messengers at once to the Gate; but they found no gold or payment. Arrows came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay.

WordCount: 26
Long will I tarry, ere I begin this war for gold. The dwarves cannot press us, unless we will, or do anything that we cannot mark.

WordCount: 27
Let us hope still for something that will bring reconciliation. Our advantage in numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy blows.

WordCount: 21
Suddenly without a signal they sprang silently forward to attack. Bows twanged and arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined.

WordCount: 19
Gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, between the advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them.

WordCount: 33
North is coming. O Dain! whose father you slew in Moria. Behold! the bats are above his army like a sea of locusts. They ride upon wolves and Wargs are in their train!

WordCount: 24
Amazement and confusion fell upon them all. Even as Gandalf had been speaking the darkness grew. The dwarves halted and gazed at the sky.

WordCount: 31
This is how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury.

WordCount: 24
Messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the North.

WordCount: 32
North hard on the heels of Dain. Not even the ravens knew of their coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the Lonely Mountain from the hills behind.

WordCount: 27
On the Southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the Elves were set; on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves.

WordCount: 26
But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a view to the North.

WordCount: 29
Soon they could see the lands before the Mountain's feet black with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and came rushing into Dale.

WordCount: 28
A few brave men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before the rest drew back and fled to either side.

WordCount: 23
Their banners were countless, black and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder. It was a terrible battle.

WordCount: 24
Behind the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt down and charged. The yells were deafening. The rocks were stained black with goblin blood.

WordCount: 23
Iron Hills plunged in, wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; and beside them came the men of the Lake with long swords.

WordCount: 22
Panic came upon the Goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new attack, the elves charged again with renewed numbers.

WordCount: 33
Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down from the main mass of the Mountain in the centre; and the defenders had too few to bar the way for long.

WordCount: 27
Vi ctory now vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the first onslaught of the black tide. Day drew on. The goblins gathered again in the valley.

WordCount: 23
There a host of Wargs came ravening and with them came the bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of steel.

WordCount: 29
Out leapt the King under the Mountain, and his companions followed him. Hood and cloak were gone; they were in shining armour, and red light leapt from their eyes.

WordCount: 28
In the gloom the great dwarf gleamed like gold in a dying fire. Rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on.

WordCount: 28
Elvenking. Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought, preparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic before the end.

WordCount: 25
Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. Really it is enough to make one weep, after all one has gone through.

WordCount: 27
Misery me! I have heard songs of many battles, and I have always understood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say distressing.

WordCount: 24
The clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the West. Seeing the sudden gleam in the gloom Bilbo looked round.

WordCount: 30
Bilbo's eyes were seldom wrong. The eagles were coming down the wind, line after line, in such a host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the North.

WordCount: 31
Bilbo cried, dancing and waving his arms. If the elves could not see him they could hear him. Soon they too took up the cry, and it echoed across the valley.

WordCount: 27
Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from above smote heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no more.

WordCount: 27
The Return Journey When Bilbo came to himself, he was literally by himself. He was lying on the flat stones of Ravenhill, and no one was near.

WordCount: 34
He sat up painfully. Looking into the valley he could see no living goblins. After a while as his head cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving in the rocks below.

WordCount: 26
He rubbed his eyes. Surely there was a camp still in the plain some distance off; and there was a coming and going about the Gate?

WordCount: 30
Dwarves seemed to be busy removing the wall. But all was deadly still. There was no call and no echo of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air.

WordCount: 21
This invisibility has its drawbacks after all. Otherwise I suppose I might have spent a warm and comfortable night in bed!

WordCount: 25
I began to wonder if even your luck would see you through! A terrible business, and it nearly was disastrous. But other news can wait.

WordCount: 21
There indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield, wounded with many wounds, and his rent armour and notched axe were cast upon the floor.

WordCount: 35
Then Bilbo turned away, and he went by himself, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse.

WordCount: 27
All that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure.

WordCount: 26
He was aching in his bones for the homeward journey. That, however, was a little delayed, so in the meantime I will tell something of events.

WordCount: 23
The Eagles had long had suspicion of the goblins' mustering; from their watchfulness the movements in the mountains could not be altogether hid.

WordCount: 24
Eagle of the Misty Mountains; and at length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of time.

WordCount: 32
It was not long before they had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on either side of the valley could come at last to the help of the battle below.

WordCount: 34
The dwarves were making a stand still about their lords upon a low rounded hill. Then Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of the fray.

WordCount: 22
Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him.

WordCount: 24
He scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him. Then dismay fell on the Goblins and they fled in all directions.

WordCount: 26
But weariness left their enemies with the coming of new hope, and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of them from escaping where they could.

WordCount: 27
Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of the goblin warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many a year.

WordCount: 34
Victory had been assured before the fall of night, but the pursuit was still on foot, when Bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save the more grievously wounded.

WordCount: 27
They would not stay here, and departed with the first light of morning. Dain has crowned their chief with gold, and sworn friendship with them for ever.

WordCount: 25
Actually it was some days before Bilbo really set out. They buried Thorin deep beneath the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone upon his breast.

WordCount: 31
There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he became King under the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls.

WordCount: 26
Of the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield and body, for he was their mother's elder brother.

WordCount: 26
This treasure is as much yours as it is mine; though old agreements cannot stand, since so many have a claim in its winning and defence.

WordCount: 30
But really it is a relief to me. How on earth should I have got all that treasure home without war and murder all along the way, I don't know.

WordCount: 26
In the end he would only take two small chests, one filled with silver, and the other with gold, such as one strong pony could carry.

WordCount: 25
So they went on until they drew near to the borders of Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out.

WordCount: 25
Then they halted, for the wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the king bade them stay a while in his halls.

WordCount: 29
They intended to go along the edge of the forest, and round its northern end in the waste that lay between it and the beginning of the Grey Mountains.

WordCount: 26
It was a long and cheerless road, but now that the goblins were crushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees.

WordCount: 25
May you ever appear where you are most needed and least expected! The oftener you appear in my halls the better shall I be pleased!

WordCount: 25
Then the elves turned towards the Forest, and Bilbo started on his long road home. He had many hardships and adventures before he got back.

WordCount: 29
Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the Forest, to the doors of Beorn's house; and there for a while they both stayed.

WordCount: 22
Bilbo left with regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were m springtime no less marvellous than in high summer.

WordCount: 31
There behind lay Mirkwood, blue in the distance, and darkly green at the nearer edge even in the spring. There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight.

WordCount: 23
Bilbo, and he turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish part was getting very tired, and the Baggins was daily getting stronger.

WordCount: 25
Homely House. Again it was evening, their ponies were tired, especially the one that carried the baggage; and they all felt in need of rest.

WordCount: 30
The Forest will grow somewhat more wholesome. The North will be freed from that horror for many long years, I hope. Yet I wish he were banished from the world!

WordCount: 32
He woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open window. Below it many elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of the stream.

WordCount: 28
And bright are the windows of Night in her tower. Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together! Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!

WordCount: 28
Sing we now softly, and dreams let us weave him! Wind him in slumber and there let us leave him! The wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be his pillow!

WordCount: 23
Lullaby! Lullaby! Alder and Willow! Sigh no more Pine, till the wind of the morn! Fall Moon! Dark be the land! Hush! Hush!

WordCount: 22
It is drawing towards dawn, and you have slept now since the night's beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of weariness.
